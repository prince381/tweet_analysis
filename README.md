# Sentiment Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis on tweets.

This is a machine learning project which focuses on performing sentiment and descriptive statistical analysis on twitter tweet data 
scraped from the twitter web page using python and textblob. This project is in two parts: 1. web scraping with requests and BeautifulSoup 
(these are tools are used for scraping data from the web in python) which will be done in a separated python script. 2. sentiment and 
descriptive statistical analysis which will be displayed in an interactive reporting dashboard. The reason for the dashboard is to allow 
you to perform the analysis on  any twitter user account you specify, provided it is valid. The sentiment analysis will be done using 
pythonâ€™s textblob module.


## Dashboard demo.
